# faculty-scheduler

This is our senior capstone project at the University of Toledo for Spring 2024.

## Overview
Currently, when you want to meet with a member of the faculty, you have to go to the office hours or check their other available hours by visiting the department office. Our goal with this project is to allow students to view and schedule meetings with faculty members, so that they can ensure that they are available when they need to meet.
